# fraud-detection-model
* This project aims to create robust fraud detection models that can handle the unique challenges presented by both e-commerce transactions and bank credit card transactions. By leveraging machine learning, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition, Adey Innovations Inc. seeks to improve its fraud detection system's precision and efficiency. Through detailed data analysis and feature engineering, these models will help detect fraudulent patterns and transactions in real-time, reducing risks and ensuring financial security.

## Content
The project involves several key steps:
1.	Data analysis and preprocessing for transaction records.
2.	Feature engineering to identify patterns linked to fraudulent behavior.
3.	Model building and training using machine learning techniques.
4.	Model evaluation and refinement to ensure accuracy.
5.	Deployment of the models for real-time detection and continuous monitoring.

## Data set overview
1.	Fraud_Data:This dataset contains transaction data from e-commerce platforms, aimed at identifying fraudulent activities. 
2. IpAddress_to_Country: This dataset provides geolocation information by mapping IP addresses to their respective countries. 
3. creditcard: This dataset contains bank credit card transaction data, curated for fraud detection.
